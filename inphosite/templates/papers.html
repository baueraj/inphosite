        <p>The successful deployment of digital technologies by humanities
scholars presents computer scientists with a number of unique sci- entific and
technological challenges. The task seems particularly daunting because issues
in the humanities are presented in abstract language demanding the kind of
subtle interpretation often thought to be beyond the scope of artificial
intelligence, and humanities scholars themselves often disagree about the
structure of their disciplines. The future of humanities computing depends on
having tools for automatically discovering complex semantic relationships among
different parts of a corpus. Digital library tools for the humanities will
need to be capable of dynamically tracking the introduction of new ideas and
interpretations and applying them to older texts in ways that support the needs
of scholars and students.</p>

    <p>This paper describes the design of new algorithms and the adjustment
of existing algorithms to support the automated and semi-automated management
of domain-rich metadata for an established digital humanities project, the
Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Our approach starts with a "hand-built"
formal ontology that is modified and extended by a combination of automated and
semi-automated methods, thus becoming a "dynamic ontology". We assess the
suitability of current information retrieval and information extraction methods
for the task of automatically maintaining the ontology. We describe a novel
measure of term-relatedness that appears to be particularly helpful for
predicting hierarchical relationships in the ontology. We believe that our
project makes a further contribution to information science by being the first
to harness the collaboration inherent in a expert-maintained dynamic reference
work to the task of maintaining and extending a formal ontology. We place
special emphasis on the task of bringing domain expertise to bear on all phases
of the development and deployment of the system, from the initial design of the
software and ontology to its dynamic use in a fully operational digital
reference work.</p>

    <h3>Answer Set Programming on Expert Feedback to Populate and Extend Dynamic Ontologies</h3>

<p>The next generation of online reference works will require structured
representations of their contents in order to support scholarly functions
such as semantic search, automated generation of cross-references, tables of
contents, and ontology-driven conceptual navigation.  Many of these works can
be expected to contain mas- sive amounts of data and be updated dynamically,
which limits the feasibility of "manually" coded ontologies to keep up with
changes in content. However, relationships relevant to inferring an ontology
can be recovered from statistical text processing, and these estimates can be
verified with carefully-solicited expert feedback. In this paper, we explain a
method by which we have used answer set programming on such expert feedback to
dynamically populate and partially infer an ontology for a well-established,
open-access reference work, the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.</p>

        <p>The Indiana Philosophy Ontology (InPhO) is a "dynamic ontology" for the domain of philosophy derived from human input and software analysis. The structured nature of the ontology supports machine reasoning about philosophers and their ideas. It is dynamic because it tracks changes in the content of the online Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. This paper discusses ways of managing the varying expertise of people who supply input to the InPhO and provide feedback on the automated methods.</p>

        <p>The application of digital humanities techniques to philosophy is changing the way scholars approach the discipline. This paper seeks to open a discussion about the difficulties, methods, opportunities, and dangers of creating and utilizing a formal representation of the discipline of philosophy. We review our current project, the Indiana Philosophy Ontology (InPhO) project, which uses a combination of automated methods and expert feedback to create a dynamic computational ontology for the discipline of philosophy. We argue that our distributed, expert-based approach to modeling the discipline carries substantial practical and philosophical benefits over alternatives. We also discuss challenges facing our project (and any other similar project) as well as the future directions for digital philosophy afforded by formal modeling.</p>

    <h3>Two Methods for Evaluating Dynamic Ontologies</h3>
    <p class="summary"><strong>Summary:</strong> Describes two novel methods for evaluating dynamic ontologies and revisits the statistical techniques of the FLAIRS 2008 paper.
    <div class="abstract">
        <a href="#KEOD2010" onClick="showAbstract(this)">show abstract</a>
        <p> Ontology evaluation poses a number of difficult
challenges requiring different evaluation methodologies, particularly for
a "dynamic ontology" representing a complex set of concepts and generated 
by a combination of automatic and semi-automatic methods. We review evaluation
methods that focus solely on syntactic (formal) correctness, on the preservation
of semantic structure, or on pragmatic utility.  We propose two novel methods
for dynamic ontology evaluation and describe the use of these methods for 
evaluating the different taxonomic representations that are generated at 
different times or with different amounts of expert feedback.  The proposed "volatility"
and "violation" scores represent an attempt to merge syntactic 
and semantic considerations. <em>Volatility</em> calculates the stability
of the methods for ontology generation and extension. <em>Violation</em> measures the degree of "ontological fit"
to a text corpus representative of the domain.  Combined, they support estimation of 
convergence towards a stable representation of the domain. No method of evaluation 
can avoid making substantive normative assumptions about what constitutes "correct"
representation, but rendering those assumptions explicit can help 
with the decision about which methods are appropriate for selecting amongst a set
of available ontologies or for tuning the design of methods used to generate a 
hierarchically organized representation of a domain.</p>
