<p>This taxonomy of ideas is the outcome of the first iteration of our cycle of
expert-provided structure, statistical analysis of the articles in the Stanford
Encyclopedia of Philosophy, and a small amount of human feedback. Iterations of
this cycle will be used to develop the taxonomy. The approach is explained in
more detail in our <a href="/papers/">papers</a>.</p>
